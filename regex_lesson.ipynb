    "# What is a Regular Expression (Regex)?\n",
    "A regular expression, commonly known as regex, is a powerful tool used in programming to describe patterns of text that can be searched for, matched, and manipulated within strings. It provides a concise and flexible means to perform complex string matching and manipulation tasks, allowing developers to efficiently handle tasks such as validation, extraction, and substitution of text data."

The floors were dirty, the customer service was nothing to talk about and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long while.FYI just because they are always busy doesn't mean they are good. McDonalds of all places!!!!\n",

      "This has to be the worst McDonald's location I have ever been to. Î¾ It is too bad since it is only a couple of miles away from the corporate headquarters you would think they would be out to impress. We walked in with nobody in front of us and waited for someone to even come to the front counter. Î¾ I always expect to have someone front and center at the counter when I walk in. Î¾Keep in mind that this was 6:30 on a Friday one would think that it would be busy for dinner. Î¾I should have picked up on the fact that nobody was even there and left. Î¾ The order was simple the bacon cheeseburger meal and a nugget kids meal. Î¾ It took forever to fulfill the order. Î¾ They have everyone running around for the drive-thru and the 3 cars in line, but nobody helping the front staff. Î¾Meanwhile the manager is per-occupied with filling the refrigerator with apple slices rather than managing the store/staff. Î¾We finally sit down and every table in the place was dirty. Î¾I had to grab some napkins and wet them down to clean off the table we sat at. Î¾ Needless to say my daughter is a slow eater so we were there for at least a 1/2 hour and never saw anyone come and clean tables. The food was horrible and not by McDonald's standards, but by human consumption standards. Î¾ The nuggets were cold the second we opened the bag. Î¾ The burger was cold and the bun was stale. Î¾ The french fries were cold and looked like they were sitting around for awhile. Î¾There was so much salt on the fries that I actually had to throw them away. Î¾ I love McDonald's french fries, but not when made here. I should have learned my lesson the first time I went to this place and the nuggets were cold last time. I miss the days when you went into a McDonald's and heard the sizzle of the grill, and the french fry frier beeping that it was done. Î¾Alas, steer clear of the Yorktown McDonald's it is nowhere near up to par as far as McDonald's standards should be.\n",

      "This particular McDonald's was extremely busy- it was about 8-9pm at night & it was super busy, wth? I waited inline for at least 10minutes before I reached the cashier. The service was okay, the staff were on their phone & talking amongst each other, there was no one out on the floor cleaning the tables or the floor and the floor had a massive spill of soda everwhere! The soda area was disgusting, there was no ice in the filler, and worst or all, the Children's Play area stunk real bad & there was a homeless guy in there just lounging, I felt scared for the children's safey!!! my gosh, he could have been a child predator for all i knew. The bathroom in this McD had 3 stalls one of which was available and the other two had locks on them which meant you needed a key- REAL GHETTO! Never again would I come to this McD. My fries were old & nasty too.this mCdonald was lucky they got my money cause I was yelping looking for the nearest MCD and it seemed like all the MCD weres packed around this area, finally this one seemed like it wasnt all that busy but it was and just plain....dirty...\n",
